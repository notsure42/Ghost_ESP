### Bug Fixes

- Display

  - Add tap to wake functionality to non battery config models
  - Keep app gallery back button on top of icons

- Power
  - Fixed an issue where the device was reporting that it was not charging when it was.

- GPS
  - Initialize GPS quality data and zero-init wardriving entries to prevent crash in wardriving mode
  - Don't check for csv file before flushing buffer over UART
  - Actually open a CSV file for wardriving when an SD card is present

## Revival v1.4.9

### ❤️ New Stuff

- Basic changeable SD Card pin out through webUI and serial command line (requires existing sd support to be enabled in your board's build)
- Added default evil portal html directly in the firmware (credit to @breaching and @bigbrodude6119 for the tiny but great html file)
- Basic congestion command to quickly see channel usage
- Added scanall command to scan aps and stations together

- Save credentials in flash when using connect command
- Captive portal now supports Android devices
- Simplified the evil-portal command line arguments.
- set LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS to 16 instead of 10

- Added support for scanning aps for a specific amount of time eg. ```scanap 10```
- Connect command now uses saved credentials from flash when no arguments are provided
- Added channel hopping to station scan
- Include BSSID in scanap output

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Use "GhostNet" as fallback default webUI credentials if G_Settings fields are not set or invalid
- Fix webUI not using evilportal command line arguments
- Fix evil‑portal local file serving
