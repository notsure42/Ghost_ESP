## Touch Screen Usage

GhostESP firmware includes touch support, enabling users to interact directly with on-screen elements. Here’s how to navigate the different menus and screens effectively.

### Touch Input Zones

Touch functionality in GhostESP is divided into specific zones for different menu types. This layout optimizes navigation, especially on screens without a dedicated touchscreen controller or with simpler touch capabilities.

#### Main Menu Navigation
In the main menu, simply tap on an item directly to select it.

#### Scroll Menus (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
For scrollable menus like the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth menus, the screen is divided into three sections to navigate more easily:

- **Top Half of Screen**: Tap here to move up one item in the menu.
- **Bottom Half of Screen**: Tap here to move down one item in the menu.
- **Middle of Screen**: Tap here to select the currently highlighted item.

#### Full-Screen Menus Without Navigation
For full-screen menus without scrollable or selectable items, tapping anywhere on the screen will return to the previous menu.

> **Note**: If you’re experiencing issues with touch responsiveness, make sure you have the latest firmware, as updates may improve touch functionality.
